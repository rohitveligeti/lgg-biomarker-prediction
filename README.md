 All the code and data visualizations

In this repository, you can see code examples of the following:

1) UMAP projections, which are useful for transforming multidimensional data into two dimensional plots to show groups of data.
2) XGBoost and Random Forests, which if you plan to implement, it is nice to have example code.
3) TCGA data and preprocessing, which is useful if you want to use TCGA data in the futureâ€“by going through this repository, you can save a lot of time getting useable data like mutations.
